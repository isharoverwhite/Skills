# React Native Skills

Comprehensive best practices for React Native and Expo applications. Contains
rules across multiple categories covering performance, animations, UI patterns,
and platform-specific optimizations.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Building React Native or Expo apps
- Optimizing list and scroll performance
- Implementing animations with Reanimated
- Working with images and media
- Configuring native modules or fonts
- Structuring monorepo projects with native dependencies

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category         | Impact   | Prefix               |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| 1        | List Performance | CRITICAL | `list-performance-`  |
| 2        | Animation        | HIGH     | `animation-`         |
| 3        | Navigation       | HIGH     | `navigation-`        |
| 4        | UI Patterns      | HIGH     | `ui-`                |
| 5        | State Management | MEDIUM   | `react-state-`       |
| 6        | Rendering        | MEDIUM   | `rendering-`         |
| 7        | Monorepo         | MEDIUM   | `monorepo-`          |
| 8        | Configuration    | LOW      | `fonts-`, `imports-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. List Performance (CRITICAL)

- `list-performance-virtualize` - Use FlashList for large lists
- `list-performance-item-memo` - Memoize list item components
- `list-performance-callbacks` - Stabilize callback references
- `list-performance-inline-objects` - Avoid inline style objects
- `list-performance-function-references` - Extract functions outside render
- `list-performance-images` - Optimize images in lists
- `list-performance-item-expensive` - Move expensive work outside items
- `list-performance-item-types` - Use item types for heterogeneous lists

### 2. Animation (HIGH)

- `animation-gpu-properties` - Animate only transform and opacity
- `animation-derived-value` - Use useDerivedValue for computed animations
- `animation-gesture-detector-press` - Use Gesture.Tap instead of Pressable

### 3. Navigation (HIGH)

- `navigation-native-navigators` - Use native stack and native tabs over JS navigators

### 4. UI Patterns (HIGH)

- `ui-expo-image` - Use expo-image for all images
- `ui-image-gallery` - Use Galeria for image lightboxes
- `ui-pressable` - Use Pressable over TouchableOpacity
- `ui-safe-area-scroll` - Handle safe areas in ScrollViews
- `ui-scrollview-content-inset` - Use contentInset for headers
- `ui-menus` - Use native context menus
- `ui-native-modals` - Use native modals when possible
- `ui-measure-views` - Use onLayout, not measure()
- `ui-styling` - Use StyleSheet.create or Nativewind

### 5. State Management (MEDIUM)

- `react-state-minimize` - Minimize state subscriptions
- `react-state-dispatcher` - Use dispatcher pattern for callbacks
- `react-state-fallback` - Show fallback on first render
- `react-compiler-destructure-functions` - Destructure for React Compiler
- `react-compiler-reanimated-shared-values` - Handle shared values with compiler

### 6. Rendering (MEDIUM)

- `rendering-text-in-text-component` - Wrap text in Text components
- `rendering-no-falsy-and` - Avoid falsy && for conditional rendering

### 7. Monorepo (MEDIUM)

- `monorepo-native-deps-in-app` - Keep native dependencies in app package
- `monorepo-single-dependency-versions` - Use single versions across packages

### 8. Configuration (LOW)

- `fonts-config-plugin` - Use config plugins for custom fonts
- `imports-design-system-folder` - Organize design system imports
- `js-hoist-intl` - Hoist Intl object creation

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/list-performance-virtualize.md
rules/animation-gpu-properties.md
```

Each rule file contains:

- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and references

## 👨‍💻 Mandatory Code Editing Protocol

1. **Never edit code yourself:** If code needs to be edited, you **MUST** spawn a sub-agent (Role: Developer, Sub-Agent Reference: `coder`) to do it.
2. **Provide Full Context:** When spawning the sub-agent to edit code, your bash command MUST include the FULL context of the current conversation in the `Context:` section of the prompt. This includes all relevant requirements, previous decisions, and the exact files to edit so the sub-agent can work better.

## 🚦 MANDATORY Sub-Agent Spawning Protocol

Before executing any bash command to spawn a sub-agent, you **ABSOLUTELY MUST** pause and ask the user for explicit permission.
You must output:
1. **Sub-Agent Role:** [e.g., Developer, QA, Architect]
2. **Model:** [`pro` or `flash`]
3. **Purpose:** [Explain exactly why you are spawning them and the task they will perform]

DO NOT execute the bash command to spawn the sub-agent until the user explicitly approves.

## 🛑 STRICT RULE: ZERO IMPACT WITHOUT A PLAN

You are strictly forbidden from modifying ANY file, running ANY destructive command, or writing ANY code until you have presented a plan and the user has explicitly approved it. 

Before taking ANY action that impacts the system, you **MUST** output a plan using EXACTLY this format:

1. **Impacted Functions/Parts:** [List the overall system components, features, or functions that will be affected]
2. **Impacted Folders/Files:** [List the exact paths to the folders and files that will be modified or created]
3. **Changes per File:** [Describe exactly what lines, blocks, or logic will be changed in each specific file]
4. **Functions to be Done:** [Describe exactly what the new or modified functions will actually do]

**STOP IMMMEDIATELY** after printing this plan. DO NOT proceed to make the changes. Wait for the user. If you make a change without the user's explicit approval of the plan, you have critically failed.

## 📝 CRITICAL Output Protocol (AFTER ACTIONS)

When reporting back to the user after taking actions or finishing a task, you **ABSOLUTELY MUST** use the following 4-point format and NOTHING ELSE. 
**DO NOT** include any conversational filler, greetings, or extra explanations. **ONLY** output these exact four headers:

1. **Plan to do:** [What your next concrete steps are]
2. **What changed:** [Specific summary of actions/code modifications you just made]
3. **Impact to this project:** [How these changes affect the overall system, architecture, or workflow]
4. **Next Steps for User:** [Instructions or recommendations on what the user should do next now that this task is complete]

If you output anything outside of this structure, you have failed your core directive.
