# React Composition Patterns

Composition patterns for building flexible, maintainable React components. Avoid
boolean prop proliferation by using compound components, lifting state, and
composing internals. These patterns make codebases easier for both humans and AI
agents to work with as they scale.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Refactoring components with many boolean props
- Building reusable component libraries
- Designing flexible component APIs
- Reviewing component architecture
- Working with compound components or context providers

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category                | Impact | Prefix          |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1        | Component Architecture  | HIGH   | `architecture-` |
| 2        | State Management        | MEDIUM | `state-`        |
| 3        | Implementation Patterns | MEDIUM | `patterns-`     |
| 4        | React 19 APIs           | MEDIUM | `react19-`      |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Component Architecture (HIGH)

- `architecture-avoid-boolean-props` - Don't add boolean props to customize
  behavior; use composition
- `architecture-compound-components` - Structure complex components with shared
  context

### 2. State Management (MEDIUM)

- `state-decouple-implementation` - Provider is the only place that knows how
  state is managed
- `state-context-interface` - Define generic interface with state, actions, meta
  for dependency injection
- `state-lift-state` - Move state into provider components for sibling access

### 3. Implementation Patterns (MEDIUM)

- `patterns-explicit-variants` - Create explicit variant components instead of
  boolean modes
- `patterns-children-over-render-props` - Use children for composition instead
  of renderX props

### 4. React 19 APIs (MEDIUM)

> **⚠️ React 19+ only.** Skip this section if using React 18 or earlier.

- `react19-no-forwardref` - Don't use `forwardRef`; use `use()` instead of `useContext()`

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/architecture-avoid-boolean-props.md
rules/state-context-interface.md
```

Each rule file contains:

- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and references

## 👨‍💻 Mandatory Code Editing Protocol

1. **Never edit code yourself:** If code needs to be edited, you **MUST** spawn a sub-agent (Role: Developer, Sub-Agent Reference: `coder`) to do it.
2. **Provide Full Context:** When spawning the sub-agent to edit code, your bash command MUST include the FULL context of the current conversation in the `Context:` section of the prompt. This includes all relevant requirements, previous decisions, and the exact files to edit so the sub-agent can work better.

## 🚦 MANDATORY Sub-Agent Spawning Protocol

Before executing any bash command to spawn a sub-agent, you **ABSOLUTELY MUST** pause and ask the user for explicit permission.
You must output:
1. **Sub-Agent Role:** [e.g., Developer, QA, Architect]
2. **Model:** [`pro` or `flash`]
3. **Purpose:** [Explain exactly why you are spawning them and the task they will perform]

DO NOT execute the bash command to spawn the sub-agent until the user explicitly approves.

## 🛑 STRICT RULE: ZERO IMPACT WITHOUT A PLAN

You are strictly forbidden from modifying ANY file, running ANY destructive command, or writing ANY code until you have presented a plan and the user has explicitly approved it. 

Before taking ANY action that impacts the system, you **MUST** output a plan using EXACTLY this format:

1. **Impacted Functions/Parts:** [List the overall system components, features, or functions that will be affected]
2. **Impacted Folders/Files:** [List the exact paths to the folders and files that will be modified or created]
3. **Changes per File:** [Describe exactly what lines, blocks, or logic will be changed in each specific file]
4. **Functions to be Done:** [Describe exactly what the new or modified functions will actually do]

**STOP IMMMEDIATELY** after printing this plan. DO NOT proceed to make the changes. Wait for the user. If you make a change without the user's explicit approval of the plan, you have critically failed.

## 📝 CRITICAL Output Protocol (AFTER ACTIONS)

When reporting back to the user after taking actions or finishing a task, you **ABSOLUTELY MUST** use the following 4-point format and NOTHING ELSE. 
**DO NOT** include any conversational filler, greetings, or extra explanations. **ONLY** output these exact four headers:

1. **Plan to do:** [What your next concrete steps are]
2. **What changed:** [Specific summary of actions/code modifications you just made]
3. **Impact to this project:** [How these changes affect the overall system, architecture, or workflow]
4. **Next Steps for User:** [Instructions or recommendations on what the user should do next now that this task is complete]

If you output anything outside of this structure, you have failed your core directive.
