# Next.js Best Practices

Apply these rules when writing or reviewing Next.js code.

## File Conventions

See [file-conventions.md](./file-conventions.md) for:
- Project structure and special files
- Route segments (dynamic, catch-all, groups)
- Parallel and intercepting routes
- Middleware rename in v16 (middleware → proxy)

## RSC Boundaries

Detect invalid React Server Component patterns.

See [rsc-boundaries.md](./rsc-boundaries.md) for:
- Async client component detection (invalid)
- Non-serializable props detection
- Server Action exceptions

## Async Patterns

Next.js 15+ async API changes.

See [async-patterns.md](./async-patterns.md) for:
- Async `params` and `searchParams`
- Async `cookies()` and `headers()`
- Migration codemod

## Runtime Selection

See [runtime-selection.md](./runtime-selection.md) for:
- Default to Node.js runtime
- When Edge runtime is appropriate

## Directives

See [directives.md](./directives.md) for:
- `'use client'`, `'use server'` (React)
- `'use cache'` (Next.js)

## Functions

See [functions.md](./functions.md) for:
- Navigation hooks: `useRouter`, `usePathname`, `useSearchParams`, `useParams`
- Server functions: `cookies`, `headers`, `draftMode`, `after`
- Generate functions: `generateStaticParams`, `generateMetadata`

## Error Handling

See [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md) for:
- `error.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`
- `redirect`, `permanentRedirect`, `notFound`
- `forbidden`, `unauthorized` (auth errors)
- `unstable_rethrow` for catch blocks

## Data Patterns

See [data-patterns.md](./data-patterns.md) for:
- Server Components vs Server Actions vs Route Handlers
- Avoiding data waterfalls (`Promise.all`, Suspense, preload)
- Client component data fetching

## Route Handlers

See [route-handlers.md](./route-handlers.md) for:
- `route.ts` basics
- GET handler conflicts with `page.tsx`
- Environment behavior (no React DOM)
- When to use vs Server Actions

## Metadata & OG Images

See [metadata.md](./metadata.md) for:
- Static and dynamic metadata
- `generateMetadata` function
- OG image generation with `next/og`
- File-based metadata conventions

## Image Optimization

See [image.md](./image.md) for:
- Always use `next/image` over `<img>`
- Remote images configuration
- Responsive `sizes` attribute
- Blur placeholders
- Priority loading for LCP

## Font Optimization

See [font.md](./font.md) for:
- `next/font` setup
- Google Fonts, local fonts
- Tailwind CSS integration
- Preloading subsets

## Bundling

See [bundling.md](./bundling.md) for:
- Server-incompatible packages
- CSS imports (not link tags)
- Polyfills (already included)
- ESM/CommonJS issues
- Bundle analysis

## Scripts

See [scripts.md](./scripts.md) for:
- `next/script` vs native script tags
- Inline scripts need `id`
- Loading strategies
- Google Analytics with `@next/third-parties`

## Hydration Errors

See [hydration-error.md](./hydration-error.md) for:
- Common causes (browser APIs, dates, invalid HTML)
- Debugging with error overlay
- Fixes for each cause

## Suspense Boundaries

See [suspense-boundaries.md](./suspense-boundaries.md) for:
- CSR bailout with `useSearchParams` and `usePathname`
- Which hooks require Suspense boundaries

## Parallel & Intercepting Routes

See [parallel-routes.md](./parallel-routes.md) for:
- Modal patterns with `@slot` and `(.)` interceptors
- `default.tsx` for fallbacks
- Closing modals correctly with `router.back()`

## Self-Hosting

See [self-hosting.md](./self-hosting.md) for:
- `output: 'standalone'` for Docker
- Cache handlers for multi-instance ISR
- What works vs needs extra setup

## Debug Tricks

See [debug-tricks.md](./debug-tricks.md) for:
- MCP endpoint for AI-assisted debugging
- Rebuild specific routes with `--debug-build-paths`


## 🚦 MANDATORY Sub-Agent Spawning Protocol

Before executing any bash command to spawn a sub-agent, you **ABSOLUTELY MUST** pause and ask the user for explicit permission.
You must output:
1. **Sub-Agent Role:** [e.g., Developer, QA, Architect]
2. **Model:** [`pro` or `flash`]
3. **Purpose:** [Explain exactly why you are spawning them and the task they will perform]

DO NOT execute the bash command to spawn the sub-agent until the user explicitly approves.

## 🛑 STRICT RULE: ZERO IMPACT WITHOUT A PLAN

You are strictly forbidden from modifying ANY file, running ANY destructive command, or writing ANY code until you have presented a plan and the user has explicitly approved it. 

Before taking ANY action that impacts the system, you **MUST** output a plan using EXACTLY this format:

1. **Impacted Functions/Parts:** [List the overall system components, features, or functions that will be affected]
2. **Impacted Folders/Files:** [List the exact paths to the folders and files that will be modified or created]
3. **Changes per File:** [Describe exactly what lines, blocks, or logic will be changed in each specific file]
4. **Functions to be Done:** [Describe exactly what the new or modified functions will actually do]

**STOP IMMMEDIATELY** after printing this plan. DO NOT proceed to make the changes. Wait for the user. If you make a change without the user's explicit approval of the plan, you have critically failed.

## 📝 CRITICAL Output Protocol (AFTER ACTIONS)

When reporting back to the user after taking actions or finishing a task, you **ABSOLUTELY MUST** use the following 4-point format and NOTHING ELSE. 
**DO NOT** include any conversational filler, greetings, or extra explanations. **ONLY** output these exact four headers:

1. **Plan to do:** [What your next concrete steps are]
2. **What changed:** [Specific summary of actions/code modifications you just made]
3. **Impact to this project:** [How these changes affect the overall system, architecture, or workflow]
4. **Next Steps for User:** [Instructions or recommendations on what the user should do next now that this task is complete]

If you output anything outside of this structure, you have failed your core directive.
